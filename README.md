# Angular 9 training

This project deals with a lot of concepts that you need to know when you start with Angular:
- Components
- Directive and Pipes
- Data binding, Event listening using Observable and Subscription
- Services
- Routing
- Forms
- Interaction with server ...

This project was generated during my Angular training in `OpenClassrooms` with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 9.1.5.
